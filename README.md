## How long did it take you to complete this assignment (in hours)?

Took me several hours. Two hours Thursday evening, then half of Friday

I had my algorithm down, but ran into issues with infinite loops when trying to filter out data's state.
Rather than filter out state, I opted to filter through the display


## What did you enjoy the most while working on this assignment?

I enjoyed the challenge of tackling something new.
I have a lot of experience with parsing and pulling out data from objects, but not much
with parsing and filtering data through nested objects.  That is where I found most difficulty.
Once I had my algorithm, I ran into issues with infinite loops, but finally opted for filtering through 
the visual end since I already had something to check against. 



#What did you learn (if anything) while working on this assignment? (optional)

I learned one way of filtering through nested object to pull out and display the necessary data 
based on a user's input.  Although the item list is small and is displayed in linear time 0(n), 
when checking if each item should be displayed per user input, I was able to check in constant time 0(1) by adding the IDs to an object and checking against that.
